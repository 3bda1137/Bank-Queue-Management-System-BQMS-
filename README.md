## Bank Queue Management System (BQMS) 
- C++ Console Application
Project Overview
Welcome to the Bank Queue Management System (BQMS) â€“ a console-based application developed in C++. The primary objective of this project is to create an efficient system for managing customer queues in a bank. The system intelligently assigns customers to available tellers, thereby minimizing wait times and ensuring optimal service.

Core Features
1-Customer Queue Management:

--->Implement a dynamic Queue structure to manage customers waiting for service.

--->Support essential operations: enqueue (customer arrival), dequeue (customer served), and display (current queue status).

2-Teller Assignment:

--->Simulate multiple tellers within the bank, each capable of serving customers.

--->Utilize either an Array or a Linked List to manage tellers, marking their status as available or busy.

3-Service Time Simulation:

--->Introduce real-world variability by randomly assigning service times to customer-teller interactions.

--->Manage teller availability dynamically, updating it as customers are served.

4-Priority Queue Option:

--->Optionally, implement a priority queue to expedite service for specific customers (e.g., special needs, elderly, premium account holders).

5-Waiting Time Analysis:

--->Calculate and display key metrics:

--->Average waiting time.

--->Average service time.

--->Teller utilization rates.


Data Structures Used

1-Queue:

--->Manages the queue of customers waiting for service.

2-Array/Linked List:

--->Handles the representation of multiple tellers, tracking their availability status.

3-Priority Queue (Optional):

--->Manages the priority customers, facilitating quicker service.

Advanced Features (Optional)

--->Dynamic Teller Allocation:

------>Implement intelligent logic to dynamically add or remove tellers based on the queue length, optimizing wait times and teller utilization.

Getting Started

1-Clone the repository to your local machine.

-----> git clone https://github.com/3bda1137/Bank-Queue-Management-System-BQMS-.git

2-Compile the C++ code using a suitable compiler.

3-Run the executable and interact with the system through the console.
